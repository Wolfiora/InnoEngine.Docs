# `SDL`: Method: Sqrt

Read these exact member contracts together with the [containing type](sdl.md) and its [shared ownership contract](../../projects/inno-native-sdl3.md#shared-abi-contract).

**Source context:** `source-clr`, configuration `Debug`. This page does not certify execution on other platforms.

## `Sqrt`

<a id="api-584a4f8dddfe9bb5"></a>
<!-- api: M:Inno.Native.Sdl3.SDL.Sqrt(System.Double) 9bd562963265ed4bd07a6ab133c07ef97320bf5aaf48a2e00808e145cd5adbb5 -->

```csharp
public static double Inno.Native.Sdl3.SDL.Sqrt(double x)
```

Compute the square root of `x`.
Domain: `0
<
= x
<
= INF`
Range: `0
<
= y
<
= INF`
This function operates on double-precision floating point values, use
SDL_sqrtf for single-precision floats.
This function may use a different approximation across different versions,
platforms and configurations. i.e, it can return a different value given
the same input on different machines or operating systems, or if SDL is
updated.

**Thread safety:** It is safe to call this function from any thread.

**Upstream availability:** This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.

**See also:** SDL_sqrtf

**Parameter `x`:** floating point value. Must be greater than or equal to 0.

**Returns:** square root of `x`.
